<title>Simulated Fantasy Baseball</title>
<h1>Simulated Fantasy Baseball</h1>
<h3>What's going on here?</h3>
<p>
	I got mad because I drafted a fantasy baseball team on <a href="https://couchmanagers.com">Couch Managers</a> right before the season was postponed. I wondered how hard it would be to simulate a season with the players I drafted.
</p>
<p>
	I built a simulator and ran a sample season. Results are  <a href="cik-anon-ga/leagueResults">here</a>.
